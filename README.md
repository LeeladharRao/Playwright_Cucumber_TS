# Playwright_Cucumber_TS

Starter template for Playwright + Cucumber POM


## Features

- Awesome report with screenshots, videos & logs
- Execute tests on multiple environments
- Github Actions integrated with downloadable report
- Page object model


## Tech

I have used the following libraries for this script:

- `Playwright` - An open-source automation library for browser testing and web scraping developed by Microsoft.
- `Cucumber` - popular BDD tool which is in simple English language very easy to read and understand.
- `TypeScript` - Better than Javascript?!
- `Github Actions` - env to execute pretty much everything using .yaml.
